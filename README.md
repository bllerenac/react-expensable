The database is seeded so you can start consuming data without creating it from scratch.
To avoid conflicts between students, each one will work with a unique user. The login
credentials would be as follow:

```js
  email: test[n]@mail.com
  password: 123456

## React - Expensable

Build a MVP of a single page application that handle personal finances..

### Requirements

The MVP should follow this technical requirements:

- It should be built with React reusable components.
- It should include Unit tests for, at least, 1 component.
- It should connect to the external API to fetch the data.
- It should use CSS in JS for the styles using Emotion.
- It should handle token based authentication. All pages except Login should be protected.
- It should be able to handle page refreshes without loosing the current state of the app. (use LocalStorage or SessionStorage when you see fit)

## Main user stories

As a user I want to...

- Login to the app with my email and password
- See a list of categories of my transactions by category type: expenses and income.
- See on each list item the name of the category, the amount of transactions it has, the total value of all the transactions and a delete button to destroy the category.
- Switch between expenses and income using a Navbar
- Delete one or more categories category.
- Logout from the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
